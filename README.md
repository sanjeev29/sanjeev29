### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

- Michigan Tech CS grad who loves turning ideas into real, usable products.
- 3+ years shipping code at startups—backend, frontend, and everything in between.
- I’m all about clean APIs, efficient databases, and smooth, scalable deployments.
- Grad school turned me into a compiler geek and I tinkered around compilers and LLVM for fun!
- Shipped live streaming, ecomm, and end-user products from idea to launch.
- Not afraid to refactor, automate, or jump into DevOps when things are on fire.
